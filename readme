**Bugs**
-Sometimes the timer does not stop at 0 and continues negatively
-a. Attempt to resovle with while loop seconds > 0
--- Triggers endgame loop, but is only called when seconds == 0
--- Timer goes from 10 to 0, must not be the incorrect usage
-b. Realize it is not always performing stopTimer function, order is correct. Leads to believe that its skipping over the endtimer to run endgame?
--- Inside the stoptimer function i put a timer check to confirm its not null, and then perform function.
--- It does pass the check inside stoptimer. After previous starttimer runs into endgame. Seconds then displays 0 and continues on. Seems like an unfinished process is resolving.
--- Refer to timer section to see i did not use window prefix in my clearinterval call.
--- Testing: It passed without issues for a while, but it did happen...curious and a bit difficult to figure out the cause when its so sporadic.
--- Returning endgame from starttimer to hopefully leave the function
